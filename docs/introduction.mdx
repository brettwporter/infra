## What is infra/brettwporter?

This is not a Terraform module hosted in GitHub or in a registry that you've typically used. This is a collection of Terraform modules that are designed to be copied into **YOUR** infrastructure and organization.

Pick the modules you need, then fork or copy and paste into your own repo. Host it as a private module in your own registry, or use it as a local module. **YOU** own it.

**EXTEND** it to your organization's needs.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why copy and paste instead of a public module?">
    The rationale is to provide you with autonomy and control over the code, enabling you to determine the setup of your infrastructure.

    Some of the drawbacks of public modules are that they are not always maintained, and they may not be designed to fit your organization's needs. They do not have the same structure and typically include more complexity which makes them harder to utilize.

    Also, since Terraform lacks a normal package manager, this approach allows you to version the modules in your own version control system, adhering to software development best practices.

<Accordion title="Can I use this in my project?">
  Absolutely. You are welcome to utilize this for both personal and commercial
  projects. There is no need for attribution. The license is
  [here](https://github.com/brettwporter/infra/blob/main/LICENSE.md). If you do
  utilize it in a project, please consider sponsoring the project.

  <Accordion title="Why is the only framework supported Terraform?">
    Terraform is the most widely used infrastructure as code tool. It is also the
    most flexible and has the most community support.

However, with Hashicorp's recent changes to the open source
licensing model, it is important to be aware
of the implications of using Terraform in your organization.
[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org) is a project that aims to provide an open
source alternative to Terraform and may be more suitable for you to use.

  <Accordion title="Why are the modules designed by application type?">
    The design of the modules mirrors the structure of an application, enhancing their comprehensibility and integration. They are crafted to be easily grasped by a typical developer, not exclusively for a DevOps or Cloud engineer.

    A website is just that - a website, not a 'website with 6 lambdas and a VPC'. Similarly, an API is just an API, not an 'API with a EC2 and a security group'. This is the way the modules are designed. They are designed to be simple and easy to understand.
